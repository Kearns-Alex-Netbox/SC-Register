#All Checked Boards

# This is a comment on how to set up these text files for the search system.
#	Each line that starts with a '#' denotes a comment and will not be looked at
#	during the reading EXCEPT FOR the first line which is read as the title.
# The first comment line is the text string that will be used to show the user which
#	file they are about to select. Each title should be relevant to what data is going
#	to be returned from the database.
# The first line that will be read should be the complete SQL script that is used
#	to combine all of the tables and columns that are needed. Each column needs to be
#	followed by an [AS ''] with the display name of the column inside the single quotes.
# The second line that will be read is the actual syntax that is needed to perform  the
#	SQL script. Include the variable name with column name in the same order that they
#	appear in the first line. This way the 'Column name' and the correct 'Syntax' will
#	be paired. THESE ARE IMPORTANT! This is what allows the program to perform  the
#	searching and sorting through the data that is returned to the datagrid.
# The third line that will be read should have at least one column from the first line
#	and all of the table joins from the first line. This will give the number of records
#	that are returned to us either on the first command or with a search.
#
# Important to remember:
#	- Each table needs to be represented with a variable even if you are using just one
#	table. This is the syntax of the program, parse, and execution and needs to be 
#	followed.
#	- Always grab the serial number with the information that you plan on showing. This 
#	makes it easier for the user to see and understand the data being presented to them.
#	- Always make the serial number the first item in the SELECT statement and the column
#	name. This is how the program will sort the data that the user searches for.
#	- The three lines that you are going to use need to go one after another. DO NOT PUT
#	EXTRA LINES IN-BETWEEN! Once the program finds the first 'readable' line, it will read
#	ONLY the next two lines and then continue the program.
#	- DO NOT put spaces after the commas in the second command line. This line gets parsed
#	out and when they are placed into the variables inside the program the spaces are
#	already being accounted for.
#	- Recommend that you first try to make the SQL command inside the SQL Database first
#	and then put it into the text file.
